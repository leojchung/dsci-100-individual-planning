To address this, I will need to clean the data by removing missing or invalid age values and filteroug out potential outliers in playtime. Then, I will create a dataset where observations represent a player with an age and their total playtime. Through this, I can visualize the relationship and then use a simple linear regression model to test whether player age predicts total playtime. The model will thus show whether age is significantly associated with how long players spend in the game."

    "\n",
    "I will be using a simple linear regression to model the relationship between player age (explanatory variable) and total playtime (response variable). This is suitable because both variables are continuous, and the goal is to test whether age can predict total playtime. It provides interpretable coefficients which indicate the direction and strength of the relationship, and helps quantify how much playtime changes with age. \n",
    "\n",
    "We must assume that a linear relationship exists between age and total playtime, that observations are independent, and that there are no influential outliers that affect the model. \n",
    "Some notable limitations are that linear regression cannot capture nonlinear or complex patterns between age and playtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is sensitive to outliers. We must also note that correlation does not imply causation, so results only show association, not influence. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will use simple linear regression to predict total playtime from age. Linear regression is ideal because the response variable is continuous, and the explanatory variable is also numeric. KNN could also be used, but for a single predictor and a simple, interpretable relationship, linear regression would be preferred. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before modeling, I will clean the data by removing missing or unrealistic values (ie. negative age or playtime). The dataset will then be randomly split into a training (70%) and testing (%30) subset to avoid overfitting. The model will be trained with the training set, and predictive accuracy will be evaluated on the test set with the RMSE metric. If neecessary, k-fold cross-validation within the training data can help ensure model stability (could use k = 5)."
